# CodeStream Backend Services

On the backend (aka. the server-side), CodeStream runs a number of services to
provide all the functionality needed for the clients. The default development
environment will use the codestream broadcaster and rabbitMQ with outbound mail
disabled.

## Development Setup with the devtools Framework

_Note: CodeStream employees should use the dev_tools sandbox as it will provide
most of the ancillary resources you'll need, most notably our development
configuration which includes secrets for pubnub, integration providers, etc...
Details [here](docs/codestream-sandbox-setup.md). Supplemental documentation is
[here](docs/README.md)._

For everyone else, read on...

## Development Setup without the devtools Framework
### Prerequisites

1. Mac or Linux computer using zsh or bash.

1. Official CodeStream builds (CI) use Nodejs 16.13.2 with npm 8.1.2

1. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) which we'll
   use to provide MongoDB and a pre-configured RabbitMQ.

If you do not wish to use docker, you'll need to provide both of these services:

1. MongoDB 3.4.9 with `mongodb://localhost/codestream` providing full access to
   create collections and indexes in the `codestream` database. If you're
   willing to run docker, the instructions below will show you how to install a
   MongoDB docker container.

1. RabbitMQ 3.7.x with the delayed message exchange plugin. You'll also need to
   create a codestream user with access. [Notes here](api_server/docs/rabbitmq.md).

### Installation

1. Fork the
   [codestream-server](https://github.com/teamcodestream/codestream-server) repo
   and clone it.

1. Setup your shell's environment
   ```
   cd codestream-server
   source dev-env.sh     # custom settings go in .sandbox-config.sh
   ```

1. Install all the node modules
   ```
   npm run install:all
   ```

1. Install the rabbitmq docker container pre-configured for codestream (the
   container name will be csrabbitmq)
   ```
   npm run run:docker:csrabbitmq
   ```

1. Create a docker volume for mongo and launch the mongodb docker container.
   The docker volume will ensure the data persists beyond the lifespan of the
   container.
   ```
   npm run run:docker:csmongo
   ```

1. In a separate shell, source in the `dev-env.sh` environment and start up the
   api service. It will repeatedly try to connect to the broadcaster. That's ok.
   Move on once you've started it.
   ```
   source dev-env.sh
   npm run start:api
   ```

1. In a another separate shell, source in the `dev-env.sh` environment and start
   up the broadcaster service.
   ```
   source dev-env.sh
   npm run start:broadcaster
   ```

1. In yet another shell, source in the `dev-env.sh` environment and start the
   onprem admin UI. This will first run webpack to build **public/bundle.js**
   (which contains the client-side code).
   ```
   source dev-env.sh
   npm run start:opadm
   ```
   If your intention is to work on the admin_server, you'll want another shell
   to run `npm run dev` which will run webpack in watch mode to keep bundle.js
   updated WRT client-side code which is stored in **src/**.

1. The inbound email service is disabled in the default config.
   ```
   source dev-env.sh
   npm run start:mailin
   ```

1. The outbound email service is also disabled in the default config.
   ```
   source dev-env.sh
   npm run start:mailout
   ```

Point your CodeStream extension to http://localhost:12000. You should be able to
register and create codemarks. The onprem admin console is at http://localhost:12002
